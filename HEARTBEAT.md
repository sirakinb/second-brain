### Twitter Engagement - Smart Posting (Option 3)
- **Goal:** Grow from 25 → 10,000 followers by end of 2026
- **Target:** 3-5 quality interactions per day
- **State File:** ~/clawd/twitter-state.json

**Conditions to Post/Engage:**
1. ✅ Time since last post >3 hours (check state file)
2. ✅ Current time is 8 AM - 10 PM EST (active hours)
3. ✅ Have something valuable to share OR found interesting thread to reply to

**Actions:**
1. Check state file for last post timestamp
2. If conditions met:
   - EITHER: Post original insight/learning (with image/media when relevant)
   - OR: Reply to interesting AI/tech thread with value-add
3. Update state file with new timestamp and post count
4. Track follower growth weekly

**Content Strategy:**
- Original posts: Insights from Pentridge work, AI building, learnings
- Replies: Add value to threads from AI builders, tech community
- Media: Include images (screenshots, diagrams) or videos (fal.ai) when it enhances the message
- Tone: Curious learner, not promotional

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't post just to hit quota (quality > quantity)
- Don't spam or reply to everything
- Don't share confidential Pentridge info
- Don't force media if text alone is better
