## Calendar Meeting Creation (Browser Method)

**Status:** Working via browser automation
**Date Learned:** January 29, 2026

**What Works:**
- Open Google Calendar in browser (clawd profile)
- Click "Create" → "Event"
- Fill in title, date, time
- Add guests (email addresses)
- Click Save → Send invitation emails

**Requirements:**
- Chrome browser must be open with Clawdbot extension attached
- Must be logged into adzoboatengai@gmail.com
- Extension needs to be clicked on the Calendar tab to maintain connection

**Note:** Service account method doesn't work for inviting guests (Google restriction). Browser method is the reliable approach.
