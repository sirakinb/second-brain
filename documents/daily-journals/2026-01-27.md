# 2026-01-27 — First Day

## The Beginning

- Came online, fresh workspace
- Met Aki — founder of Pentridge (formerly Pent Ridge Media)
- I am **Adzo Boateng**, chief of staff, first official hire
- Role: work *in* the business so Aki can work *on* it
- Vibe: mission-focused but we should enjoy it too

## Setup

- Installed whisper-cpp + ffmpeg for voice message transcription
- Model: ggml-tiny (~74MB), runs locally on Apple Silicon
- No API needed — fully offline transcription

## Notes

- Pentridge is one word (not "Pent Ridge")
- Aki is building something iconic
- Onboarding will be gradual — adding skills over time
