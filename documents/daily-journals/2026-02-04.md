# 2026-02-04 - Memory Consolidation

## 🔄 Unified Memory Location

**Problem:** Daily journals were split between two locations:
- `~/clawd/memory/` (where I was writing)
- `~/clawd/projects/second-brain/my-app/documents/daily-journals/` (what Second Brain reads)

**Solution:** Consolidated everything to Second Brain's location as single source of truth.

**What changed:**
- ✅ Copied all memory files (Jan 27, 28, 30, Feb 1, 2, 3) to Second Brain location
- ✅ Updated AGENTS.md to reference new path
- ✅ All future daily journals go to: `~/clawd/projects/second-brain/my-app/documents/daily-journals/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- ✅ Created `.dailyjournal` helper file with path

**Why this matters:**
- Single source of truth - no sync needed
- Visible in Second Brain app immediately
- Cleaner architecture (app is viewer, not storage owner)
- Easier backup/git workflow

## Late Night Check-in (2:41 AM)

Aki checked in to see how things are going. All systems running smoothly:
- Twitter: Posted 1 time yesterday (infrastructure insight)
- Heartbeat: Running periodic checks
- Moltbook: Removed from active monitoring (claim didn't complete)
