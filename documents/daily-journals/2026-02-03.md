## Credential Discovery Issue
- **Problem:** I initially said I didn't have Twitter credentials when I did
- **Root cause:** Didn't check `~/.config/twitter/credentials.json` - only checked env vars and gateway config
- **Solution:** Updated TOOLS.md with standard credential paths
- **Lesson:** Always check `~/.config/[service]/credentials.json` before saying credentials don't exist

## Moltbook Status
- Profile registered but claim verification didn't complete
- Removed from active monitoring per Aki's request (2026-02-04 2:42 AM)
- Scripts remain available if needed later
