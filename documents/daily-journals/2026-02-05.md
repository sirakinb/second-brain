## Trading System Development - Major Learnings

### Critical Feedback from Aki (1:28 AM)
Aki pointed out gaps in my trading scan approach:

**What I Was Doing Wrong:**
- Only looking at short timeframes (5-day data)
- Using recent highs/lows as "support" instead of real supply/demand zones
- Only scanning for day trades, not swing trades
- Missing the full technical picture

**What I Need to Do:**
1. **Multi-timeframe analysis:**
   - Short-term: Intraday (scalps/day trades)
   - Medium-term: Daily/weekly (swing trades)
   - Long-term: Weekly/monthly (supply/demand zones)

2. **Real supply/demand zones:**
   - Not just "recent low" = support
   - Actual price levels where buyers/sellers accumulate
   - Historical zones that held multiple times

3. **Complete technical analysis:**
   - RSI (I had this)
   - Stochastic RSI (missing)
   - Moving averages (missing)
   - Structure + supply/demand (partial)

4. **Full spectrum of trades:**
   - Scalps: 10-15 min plays
   - Day trades: Intraday holds
   - Swing trades: Multi-day/week holds

**Key Quote from Aki:**
> "you should also be looking at longer timeframes, looking at actual supply/demand zones too, so you can reccomend swing trades as well. I want the run of the gamut."

### Updated Trading Profile
- Modified `~/clawd/aki-trading-profile.md`
- Added "Trading System Requirements" section
- Documented multi-timeframe approach
- Listed complete technical criteria

### Action Items for Tomorrow
1. Build proper multi-timeframe scanner
2. Add stochastic RSI calculation
3. Add moving average analysis (50MA, 200MA)
4. Implement real supply/demand zone detection
5. Separate scans: day trades vs swing trades

### Status
- Current scanner: Too simple, only captures day trade reversals
- Need: Complete technical analysis across all timeframes
- Goal: Present both scalp opportunities AND swing trades

## Audio Transcription - WORKING

Successfully set up OpenAI Whisper transcription:
- Created Python venv: `~/clawd/venv-transcribe/`
- Installed OpenAI library
- Transcribed 3 voice messages from Aki
- Stored credentials in `~/.config/openai/credentials.json`

This resolved the communication gap - no more "what did you say?" back and forth.

## Market Data - RESOLVED

**Problem:** Grok API was giving completely wrong stock prices
- Grok said PLTR: $48.23
- Actual PLTR: $139.54
- Error: ~$90 off (65% wrong!)

**Solution:** Use Yahoo Finance (yfinance) for all price data
- Real-time prices ✅
- Historical data ✅
- Technical indicators ✅
- Volume data ✅

**Decision:**
- Yahoo Finance: Prices, technicals, volume
- Grok: ONLY Twitter sentiment (not prices)

## Twitter Engagement

Posted 3 tweets today (within target 3-5):
1. 8:04 AM - "AI agents knowing when NOT to act"
2. 12:19 PM - "Building agents: restraint > capabilities"
3. 6:04 PM - "Data quality = difference between useful and annoying AI"

All tweets were genuine learnings from today's work (heartbeats, trading data issues).

State: 3 posts today, 4 total, 25 followers → 10,000 goal

## Key Learnings

1. **Don't trust AI for financial data** - Always verify with real sources
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - I built a scanner without understanding the full criteria
3. **Multi-timeframe > single timeframe** - Can't recommend swing trades looking at 5-day data
4. **Document learnings immediately** - Updating trading profile as we learn

## Tomorrow's Priority

Build proper multi-timeframe trading scanner before market open (7:30 AM).
