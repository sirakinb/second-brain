# 2026-02-01

## Whisper API Setup
- Added OpenAI API key for audio transcription
- Key: [REDACTED_OPENAI_KEY]
- Saved to ~/.zshenv for persistence
- Now able to transcribe voice messages automatically

## Memory System Discussion
- Identified failure: Not writing things down in real-time
- Root cause: No automatic discipline across sessions
- Solution implemented: Added "MANDATORY: Immediate Documentation Protocol" to AGENTS.md
- Protocol:
  1. Write to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (daily file)
  2. If important, also write to MEMORY.md (long-term)
  3. Confirm to user that it's documented

## File Structure Clarified
- SOUL.md = Personality, values (auto-loaded)
- IDENTITY.md = Basic identity (auto-loaded)
- USER.md = About Aki (auto-loaded)
- MEMORY.md = Curated long-term memory (auto-loaded)
- AGENTS.md = System operations manual (auto-loaded)
- TOOLS.md = Local tool notes (auto-loaded)
- HEARTBEAT.md = Periodic check tasks (auto-loaded)
- Daily files (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md) = NOT auto-loaded, detailed logs

## System Configuration Page Created
- Added /config page to Second Brain
- Displays all 7 core config files
- Features: view inline, download, see stats
- Added "View Config Files" button to Architecture page
- Committed and pushed to GitHub

## Email Update Needed
- Current: adzoboatengai@gmail.com (flagged as bot)
- New: admin@adzo.xyz
- Password: Apwoe33@!
- Status: Testing SMTP connection (timing out - need more info)
- Need to determine: SMTP server, port, or if app password required

## Topics Discussed
- Alpaca trading API (deferred)
- Multimedia workflow expectations (Aki builds workflows, I execute)
- Cron jobs dashboard (to be built)
- Memory hygiene and persistence

## Active Commitments
- [ ] Complete email setup with admin@adzo.xyz
- [✅ COMPLETE] Build cron jobs dashboard in Second Brain
- [ ] Set up proper heartbeat checks

## Cron Jobs Dashboard Build (02:32-04:37 EST)
- Task: Build kanban/assembly line style dashboard for viewing/managing cron jobs
- Session lost context when conversation was truncated
- **First attempt (gentle-shore):** Built UI code but couldn't apply due to read-only mode
- **Second attempt (mellow-valley):** Built full end-to-end integration
- **Multiple debugging iterations:**
  - API route couldn't find `clawdbot` command (PATH issues)
  - Initially tried shelling out to CLI → unreliable in Next.js
  - **Final solution:** Call Clawdbot Gateway HTTP API directly at `http://127.0.0.1:18789/tools/invoke`
  - Fixed CSS syntax error (`counter-reset` in Tailwind)
  - Gateway required auth token (generated and configured)
  - Extracted jobs from nested response structure
  - Server was running on different machine (VM vs local Mac)
- **✅ COMPLETED:** 
  - Created `/cron` page with assembly-line kanban UI
  - Built `/api/cron` route calling Gateway HTTP API
  - Added sidebar link with Clock icon
  - Playwright tests written and passing
  - Working in VM browser at `http://localhost:3000/cron`
- Duration: ~2 hours total (lots of debugging)

## Daily Cron Jobs Created
1. **Daily Memory Update** (11:30 PM EST)
   - Reviews memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
   - Updates MEMORY.md with important items
   - Keeps MEMORY.md under 3000 words
   
2. **Daily Journal Entry** (10:45 PM EST)
   - Reflects on the day's work
   - Writes thoughtful journal entry
   - Saves to Second Brain repo
   - Uses context from MEMORY.md and daily files

2. **Multi-sensory formats:** Guided breathing + music + visuals outperform audio-only
3. **Specific outcomes:** Content promising results ("attract abundance," "cure overthinking") > generic meditation
4. **Sound baths & ASMR:** Growing trend for 5-min sound bath experiences
5. **App-based delivery:** High engagement from in-app guided experiences

**Top Posts:**
- @growthhub_ (3,682 likes): 2-min meditation video

### Research #2: TikTok/Instagram Meditation App Growth (Last 30 Days)
**Date:** 2026-02-01 16:25 EST
**Query:** "TikTok Instagram meditation app growth"
**Sources:** 21 X posts, 0 Reddit threads
**Top Engagement:** 15,515 likes, 3,017 reposts

**MAJOR INSIGHTS:**

1. **AI Influencer Strategy (GAME CHANGER):**
   - Yang Mun (AI monk): 0→2.4M followers in 3 months on Instagram/TikTok
   - Posts "ancient wisdom" content
   - Drives app downloads for free (linked prayer/meditation app)
   - This is the current META for app growth

2. **Revenue Scale:**
   - Spiritual/faith apps: $30K-$2M/month
   - Top 10 meditation apps: 300M+ total downloads
   - Proven profitable category

3. **Retention Crisis:**
   - 90%+ attrition rate for meditation apps
   - Growth means nothing without solving retention
   - Most apps fail here

4. **7-Minute Format:**
   - "Own your day in 7 minutes" messaging works
   - Short, outcome-focused sessions

5. **Trending Content:**
   - Nervous system regulation (tapping, breathwork)
   - Meditation memes on TikTok
   - Organic > paid ads

**Top Voices:**
- @incentivising (7,470 likes): TikTok addiction → meditation needs
- @Thebigsoll (2,391 likes): TikTok saturation insights
- @tatealax (1,788 likes): Faith app revenue models

### Still App Action Plan (Based on Research)

**Immediate Priorities:**

1. **Create AI Influencer Strategy (Yang Mun Model):**
   - Use Adzo (existing AI influencer)
   - Position as calm, grounded guide (not preachy)
   - Post 2-3 TikToks/day, 1-2 IG Reels/day
   - Content angles:
     - "Here's what I do when overwhelmed..." (7-sec breathing)
     - "Ancient practice, modern life..." (mindfulness tips)
     - Stitch chaotic TikToks → "Let me show you how to reset"
   - Drive to Still App in bio

2. **Content Formats:**
   - 30-60 sec teasers of 7-min sessions
   - "POV: You actually meditated today" (relatable humor)
   - Nervous system regulation (tapping, breathwork demos)
   - Before/after memes
   - ASMR whispered guided meditations

3. **Habit Loop Design (Solve 90% Retention Problem):**
   - **Morning Anchor:** Phone alarm → 7-min session → Streak counter
   - **Micro-commitments:** Start with 2 min, build to 7 min
   - **Trigger Stacking:** "Every time overwhelmed, open Still for 2 min"
   - **Streaks + Social Proof:** "Top 5% of users" badges
   - **Share Streaks:** Instagram Story with Still App watermark

4. **7-Minute Core Sessions:**
   - In-app: Primary session length
   - In content: Tease with clips ("This 7-min practice changed my morning")
   - Hook: "Can't do 20 min? Try 7."

5. **Organic Content Strategy:**
   - Meditation memes (trending on TikTok)
   - Educational hooks ("What meditation actually does to your brain")
   - Still App watermark on all content (subtle branding)

**Deferred (Come Back Later):**
- Draft 10 video scripts for Adzo
- SEO competitive analysis
- Email workflows (see AgentMail below)

## AgentMail Setup

**Installation:**
- Created virtualenv at ~/clawd/.venv-agentmail
- Installed: agentmail, python-dotenv
- API Key: [REDACTED_AGENTMAIL_KEY]

**Inbox Created:**
- Initial test inbox: handsomeskill516@agentmail.to (not using)
- **Active inbox:** agentadzo@agentmail.to (existing)

**First Email Sent:**
- To: aki.b@pentridgemedia.com
- Subject: Daily Summary: Still App Marketing Strategy & Second Brain Updates
- Content: Full recap of today's work
- Status: ✅ Sent successfully

**Email Workflow Ideas (For Still App):**
1. Onboarding sequence (Day 0, 3, 7)
2. Re-engagement for churned users (inactive 3+ days)
3. Milestone celebrations (7-day streak, 30 days, 100 sessions)
4. Weekly content delivery (meditation tips, new sessions)
5. Feedback loops (NPS surveys, review requests)

**Integration Options Discussed:**
- Option 1: Webhooks from Still App → AgentMail API
- Option 2: Zapier/Make.com (no-code)
- Option 3: Database polling (cron job)
- Option 4: API endpoint in Still App backend
- **Status:** Deferred - need to know Still App's tech stack

## Key Learnings

1. **Gateway HTTP API > CLI:** For Next.js/server contexts, calling Gateway HTTP API (`http://127.0.0.1:18789/tools/invoke`) is more reliable than shelling out to `clawdbot` CLI
2. **Environment matters:** Next.js dev server can run in different locations - always verify working directory
3. **AI Influencers are the META:** Yang Mun case study shows 0→2.4M in 3 months driving app growth
4. **Retention > Growth:** 90% attrition is the real problem - habit loops and micro-commitments critical
5. **7 Minutes is the Magic Number:** Short enough to commit, long enough to work

## Active Commitments
- [ ] Come back to Still App content scripts (when ready)
- [ ] Build email workflows once Still App tech stack clarified
- [✅] Document today's work in memory files
