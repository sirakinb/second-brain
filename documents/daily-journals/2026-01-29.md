**Tool Stack Philosophy:** Today established a pattern: install foundational tools (browser automation, search, research), then apply them to specific business problems (trading, client work, product development).

**Communication Rhythm:** Daily 10:08 PM check-ins provide structure. Moving to 4 AM allows Aki to wake up to organized thoughts.
