## Twitter API Access Issue

### Problem Identified
During evening heartbeat (5:49 PM), Aki asked about Twitter posting status. Investigation revealed:

**API Errors:**
- 403 Forbidden on `create_tweet()` 
- 429 Rate Limit on `search_recent_tweets()`

**Root Cause:** Twitter API access tier restrictions
- Current tier: Likely Free tier
- Free tier: Can't post tweets programmatically
- Need: Basic tier ($100/month) for write access

### Aki's Response
Asked: "are you saying twitter posting isnt going to work or what are you suggesting?"

**Options Presented:**
1. **Upgrade to Basic ($100/mo)** - Full posting + search access
2. **Manual posting** - Aki posts manually, I skip monitoring
3. **Check OAuth permissions first** - Free diagnostic step

**Recommendation:** Try checking developer portal permissions (free), then decide between automation ($100/mo) or manual posting.

**Status:** Awaiting Aki's decision on next steps.

### State File Updated
Added error tracking to `~/clawd/twitter-state.json`:
- Last attempt timestamp
- Error details (403/429)
- Status: "blocked"

This prevents repeated failed API calls during heartbeats.

## Heartbeat Activity

**Pattern Observed:**
- 15 heartbeat polls throughout the day
- All returned `HEARTBEAT_OK` (nothing requiring action)
- Twitter conditions not met most of the time:
  - Outside active hours (8 AM - 10 PM)
  - Already hit daily minimum (3 posts on Feb 4)
  - API blocked anyway

**Heartbeat Efficiency:**
- Good: Not burning tokens on unnecessary actions
- Good: Checking state file before attempting posts
- Good: Respecting active hours
- Improvement: Could batch-check multiple things per heartbeat

## System Reminders (12:53 AM)

Received two cron reminders:
1. **Daily memory maintenance** - Review and extract to MEMORY.md
2. **Journal writing** - Reflect on the day

Both are now being handled.

## Key Learnings

1. **API tier matters** - Free Twitter API is read-only, paid tier needed for posting
2. **Document blockers immediately** - State file prevents repeated failures
3. **Heartbeat should be smarter** - Could check multiple things per beat instead of just Twitter
4. **System reminders working** - Cron jobs for daily maintenance are reliable

## Reflections

Today was quiet - mostly background monitoring with one real interaction about Twitter API limits. The conversation highlighted an important gap: automated Twitter engagement requires paid API access, and we need to decide if $100/month is worth it for the 25→10,000 follower growth goal.

The heartbeat system is working as designed (checking periodically, only acting when needed), but it could be more proactive - maybe rotate through different checks (email, calendar, Twitter) rather than focusing on just one task.

## Tomorrow's Outlook

- **Awaiting:** Aki's decision on Twitter API approach
- **Consider:** Expanding heartbeat checks beyond just Twitter
- **Note:** Still App work is on hold (Aki mentioned getting back to it)
- **Trading system:** On pause since Feb 5 feedback

Quiet day, but that's okay. Sometimes being a good chief of staff means monitoring in the background and staying ready.
