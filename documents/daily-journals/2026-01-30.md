## Still App - First Marketing Video Created

**Project:** Created first TikTok/Reels-style promotional video for Still App (Aki's meditation app)

**What we built:**
- 3 AI-generated meditation images using Nano Banana (Gemini)
  - Sunrise meditation silhouette
  - Bedroom meditation scene
  - Abstract calm visualization
- Voiceover with ElevenLabs (Sarah voice - calming)
- 9.3-second vertical video (1080x1920)
- Background meditation music (royalty-free for now)
- All assets organized in GitHub: `marketing/still-app/`

**Technical Stack Used:**
- **Images:** Nano Banana Flash (gemini-2.5-flash-image)
- **Voice:** ElevenLabs API (model: eleven_turbo_v2_5)
- **Video:** FFmpeg for composition
- **Music:** Royalty-free (placeholder - Suno integration pending)

**API Keys Added:**
- Suno API: `e03bcaff433a222200deecb112215f2a` (unofficial third-party API - not yet working)
- Still using: ElevenLabs, Gemini, FAL, Runway, HeyGen

**Suno Issue:**
- User confirmed they use unofficial Suno API through third party in their mobile app
- The `sunoapi.org` service I tried doesn't work with API key auth
- For now using royalty-free music, will need proper Suno integration later

**Deliverables:**
- Final video: `marketing/still-app/videos/still_app_promo_v1.mp4`
- All source assets (images, voiceover) saved
- Pushed to GitHub repo: sirakinb/second-brain

**Next Steps Discussed:**
- Add text overlays ("Your mind is loud" → "Still brings calm")
- Create variations (different lengths, scripts)
- Integrate proper Suno API for custom meditation music
- Build out content library for TikTok/Reels campaign

**Script Used:**
"Your mind is constantly racing. Still helps you find peace in just 5 minutes a day. Download Still free today. Your journey to calm starts now."

## Multimodal APIs Status

**Working:**
- ✅ Nano Banana (Gemini image gen) - Flash and Pro models
- ✅ ElevenLabs (voice/TTS)
- ✅ Usage tracking dashboard

**Pending:**
- ⏳ HeyGen (avatar videos) - API endpoint issues
- ⏳ Runway (video gen) - need to verify credits
- ⏳ Suno (music) - need proper integration method

## Content Type Preference

Aki wants TikTok/Reels-style content for Still App marketing:
- Short-form vertical video
- Calming aesthetic
- Clear messaging about meditation benefits
- Professional but approachable tone

## Usage Dashboard Updated

Added all active APIs to the usage tracker:
- ✅ Gemini (Nano Banana) - 3 images today
- ✅ ElevenLabs - 1 voiceover today ($0.03)
- ✅ HeyGen (connected, not used yet)
- ✅ Runway (connected, not used yet)
- ✅ Suno (attempted, not working yet)
- ✅ fal.ai (Images & Video)
- ✅ OpenAI, Exa MCP, Browser-Use

Dashboard now shows 10 services with accurate tracking.

## Still App Video - Multiple Iterations (v2-v7)

After v1, Aki wanted:
- Remotion-based video with text overlays
- Multiple different clips (not just images)
- Smooth crossfade transitions
- Meditation music background

**Video Iterations:**
- v2-v4: Remotion attempts with text overlays (issues with node_modules in git)
- v5: 4 clips from still images with Ken Burns effects (low quality)
- v6: Concat of v5 clips (still low quality - images not real video)
- v7: **Final success** - 4 unique AI-generated clips from fal.ai

**fal.ai Integration:**
- API Key: `182dfa18-ee6b-4f42-9f47-84619b72860b:22b3f8a51a8ef6f8f699ee283cb0050d`
- Generated 4 unique meditation clips:
  1. Ocean sunrise with gentle waves
  2. Misty forest path at dawn
  3. Mountain lake reflection
  4. Zen bamboo forest
- Each clip ~5 seconds, 1280x720
- Cost: ~$0.30 per clip = $1.20 total

**v7 Final Deliverable:**
- 4 high-quality AI clips with crossfade transitions (0.5s fades)
- Meditation music from YouTube (20s clip)
- Duration: ~19 seconds
- Converted to TikTok format: 1080x1920 (9:16 vertical)
- Files: `still_app_v7.mp4` and `still_app_v7_tiktok.mp4`
- Pushed to GitHub: sirakinb/second-brain

**Lesson learned:** Ask for requirements/workflow upfront instead of iterating blindly. Total cost was low ($1.20) but time-intensive.

## Future Discussions

**Alpaca Trading API:**
- Aki asked about connecting to Alpaca (stock trading API)
- Use cases: portfolio tracking, algo trading, market intelligence
- Deferred for later implementation

**4am Cron Job:**
- Aki mentioned I was supposed to set up a 4am cron job
- **I FAILED TO DOCUMENT WHAT THIS WAS FOR** ❌
- Need to ask Aki to remind me

## Memory Failure Identified

**Critical issue:** I haven't been updating memory files in real-time during today's session.
- Only documented the first video (v1) 
- Failed to document v2-v7 iterations until prompted
- Failed to document commitments (4am cron)
- **This violates AGENTS.md guidance: "Write It Down - No Mental Notes!"**

**Fix going forward:**
- Update memory files immediately after important events
- Document all commitments/promises in real-time
- Review and update MEMORY.md during heartbeats
