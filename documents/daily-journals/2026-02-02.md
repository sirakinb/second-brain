## Google Calendar & Docs Integration - COMPLETE
**Problem:** AgentMail can send emails but cannot create actual Google Calendar events or edit Google Docs

**Solution:** Set up Google APIs with OAuth using adzo@pentridgemedia.com credentials

**Setup Process:**
1. Created Google Cloud project: "Adzo-Automation"
2. Enabled APIs: Google Calendar API, Google Docs API, Google Drive API
3. Created OAuth Desktop app credentials
4. Downloaded credentials.json
5. Ran OAuth flow - Aki authorized in browser
6. Saved refresh token to: ~/.config/google/token.pickle

**Credentials:**
- Email: adzo@pentridgemedia.com
- Password: [REDACTED_PASSWORD]
- OAuth tokens: ~/.config/google/token.pickle (refresh token lasts forever)

**Capabilities:**
✅ Create Google Calendar events
✅ Send calendar invites (from adzo@pentridgemedia.com)
✅ Create Google Docs
✅ Edit Google Docs
✅ Create/manage Google Drive folders
✅ Read Aki's calendar (aki.b@pentridgemedia.com)

**Permissions:**
- Can READ Aki's calendar (aki.b@pentridgemedia.com)
- Cannot EDIT Aki's calendar (need additional permission)
- Can create/edit on adzo@pentridgemedia.com calendar

**First Tests:**
1. Calendar Event Created:
   - Title: "Trading Tests"
   - Date: February 3, 2026 at 4:30 PM EST
   - Attendee: aki.b@pentridgemedia.com
   - Organizer: adzo@pentridgemedia.com
   - Status: Invite sent successfully

2. Google Doc Created:
   - Title: "Adzo Onboarding - Last 24 Hours"
   - Location: Google Drive in "Onboarding" folder
   - Content: Complete summary of everything done Feb 1-2
   - Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10SYhI-LTE5Df20PRv991o3r2XkjOVnHZsl8n2C379wU/edit
   - Shared via email to aki.b@pentridgemedia.com

3. Calendar Check:
   - Confirmed access to aki.b@pentridgemedia.com calendar
   - Wednesday, Feb 4, 2026 events:
     * Charts at 8:30 AM EST
     * Vibe Coding Pioneers Meeting at 7:00 PM EST (recurring event)
   - Note: For recurring events, must check parent event for proper title

## Important Learnings

### OAuth Refresh Tokens Don't Expire
- One-time browser authorization
- Refresh token saved and lasts forever
- Auto-refreshes access tokens in background
- No manual re-authorization needed
- This solves the "OAuth expiring" problem from before

### Calendar Event Titles for Recurring Events
- When listing calendar events via API, recurring instances may not show summary
- Must fetch parent event details to get proper title
- Example: "Vibe Coding Pioneers Meeting" showed as "[No title]" initially
- Now know to check parent event for recurring events

### Email vs Calendar Systems
- **AgentMail (agentadzo@agentmail.to):** Basic email sending, no attachments yet
- **Google Calendar API:** Direct calendar event creation, invites from adzo@pentridgemedia.com
- **Google Docs API:** Create/edit docs, share via Drive
- These are separate systems that complement each other
- Cannot send emails FROM adzo@pentridgemedia.com via AgentMail (only from agentadzo@agentmail.to)

### Professional Communication Rule - CRITICAL
**Added to AGENTS.md:**
- NO EMOJIS in emails or Google Docs
- Professional tone for external documents
- Clear, concise language
- Emojis fine in chat/Telegram, not in formal communication

Examples:
- ❌ Email: "Hi! 🎉 Here's the doc 📄"
- ✅ Email: "Hi, here's the document you requested."
- ✅ Telegram: "Done! Check your email 📧"

## Trading System Development - STARTED

**Goal:** Take $300 → $100,000 in 2026

**Background:**
- Aki has been trading for 6 years (stocks, options, crypto, futures, Forex)
- Most successful: 2020-2021 (bull market, strict rules, less complexity)
- Worst period: 2022 (overleveraging in crypto during bear market)

**Interview Completed:**
- Created comprehensive trading profile: ~/clawd/aki-trading-profile.md
- Documented experience, setup, psychology, weaknesses
- Identified patterns: simplicity + discipline = success, overleveraging = failure

**Current Setup:**
- Live $300 account on Robinhood (options-focused)
- Prop firm accounts running parallel
- Available during NY session (8:30-11:30 AM EST) but sporadic
- Future: Alpaca API integration for automation

**Trading Style:**
- Natural swing trader, currently focusing on day trades
- Sweet spot: 10-15 minute scalps to intraday holds
- Entry triggers: FOMO, gut feel, setup confirmation (should only trade on confirmation)
- Exit triggers: Target hit (planned) or fear (emotional)

**Known Weaknesses:**
- Greed
- Recklessness
- Carelessness/sloppiness
- All three feed each other

**What Adzo Needs to Provide:**
1. Trade guidance (which trades to take)
2. Research using xAI API (web/Twitter for trending assets and setups)
3. Systematic approach to combat weaknesses
4. Position sizing rules to prevent overleveraging
5. Eventually: Alpaca API integration

**Key Insight from Aki:**
"I didn't know as much [in 2020-2021], it was easier to just adhere to a stricter rule set"
→ Lesson: Simplicity + discipline beats complexity without discipline

**Status:** Profile complete, ready to build systematic trading rules

**Next Steps:**
1. Define exact setup criteria (what is "setup confirmation"?)
2. Position sizing rules for $300 account
3. Daily research process
4. Trade journal system
5. Alpaca API integration plan

## Twitter/X API Integration - COMPLETE

- Access Token: 1870553779067834368-iAitWnO6mfT3sBcd3UIajMT7w64uyc
- Access Token Secret: 1Kr7ivMONFjs9Q1EjLNAjg0AzurUC41iaRFw5gr5d5OZf

## Twitter Growth Strategy - IMPLEMENTED

**Goal:** Grow from 25 → 10,000 followers by end of 2026

**Approach:** Smart Heartbeat (Option 3)
- Check conditions during each heartbeat
- Only post when: >3 hours since last post, active hours (8-10 PM EST), have value to add
- Target: 3-5 quality interactions per day

**Files Created:**
1. ~/clawd/twitter-state.json - Track last post, daily count, follower growth
2. ~/clawd/twitter-post.py - Helper script for posting with media support

**Content Strategy:**
- Original posts: Insights from Pentridge work, learnings, AI building
- Replies: Add value to AI/tech threads
- Media: Include images/videos when it enhances message (fal.ai for videos)
- Tone: Curious learner, not promotional

**HEARTBEAT.md Updated:**
- Added Twitter engagement task with smart conditions
- Quality over quantity approach
- Don't post just to hit quota

**Current State:**
- Account: @adzoai
- Followers: 25
- Posts: 1,535 (existing)
- Note: "Automated by @Defi__Papi" label still showing (trying to remove via dev portal)

**Next Steps:**
- Start posting during heartbeats when conditions met
- Track follower growth weekly
- Adjust strategy based on what works
